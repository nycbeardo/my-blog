***As you may or may not know,  I am currently on my journey to becoming better at JavaScript and React.***

This has been easy at times but harder as the topics get more complicated  and I continue to grow as a developer. One of
the topics that have been difficult but interesting is how Event Handlers are dealt with in React. 


***To give a little bit of background info on this particular topic:***

*Event handlers help keep track of every action performed by the user. *
*This can be anything from resizing a window, clicking on links, a page scrolling, all of which are processed by event handlers. *

### Things to keep in mind: 

1. The naming of events in React are of great importance, and adding events is similiar to how they are added to DOM elements.

2. Synthetic events play a role, as they are needed to provide event details and can be passed into event handlers as well as callback functions.

3. Defining events using JSX: use the camelCase event with the handler or callback function as the property of the JSX that is a placeholder for the element in React.

My first exposure to event handlers came in the form of tutorials in the Learn ReactJS course on Codecademy. 
While it was only a small preview, that part of the lesson gave me insight into updating parent and child components in React through the use of event handlers. 
Continuing onward, I want to make sure that the concepts that I am being exposed to will help me in the implementation aspect when building new projects. I have a long way to go with becoming stronger in React, and while this topic was a challenge, 
determining the logic behind it helped to broaden my understanding and increase my knowledge base.

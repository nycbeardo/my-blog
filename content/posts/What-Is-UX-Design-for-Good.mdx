As youre well aware, this year has been unlike anything we could've imagined. 
In the states in particular, the pandemic give way to protests following the death of George Floyd and radical shift in the
national and global conversation about how society treats it's most vulnerable and marginalized groups. 

Many companies and studios whose industries include tech and design, 
which in the past have avoided or downplayed issues with race and diversity, found themseleves having to show some form of support

While in some cases it seemed genuine, most displays of solidarity were just that... dispalys. 
Many had no comprehensive plan on how to combat the lack of diversity, the lack of opportunites for underrepresented groups, and lack of 
diverse leadership.

## You may wonder why is that important or you may think its not a big deal. Well I got news for you, IT IS!

When it comes to the creation of products and services for the web and how they are developed and designed, who is chosen to
take on the tasks of doing that is intentional and most likely have a skewed viewpoint of the world they live in. 

Most of the time they are usually White and sometimes Asian, with no further representation of other groups. 
The decisions that places only those people in positions can have consequences for users, the ones they have in mind and the ones they dont have in mind.
